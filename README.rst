FyCollections â€” Generic collection templates for Fortran
========================================================

FyCollections offers generic collection templates for Fortran. It consists of a
lightweight backend library and templates for each collection type. Using the
templates, various collections (lists, maps, etc.) can be easily created for
arbitrary Fortran data structures. The templates are written in the `Fypp
preprocessor <http://bitbucket.org/aradi/fypp>`_ language.

At the current early stage of development, no extensive documentation is
available yet. Have a look at the examples in the ``examples/`` folder for
demonstration of usage.

The project is `hosted on bitbucket
<http://bitbucket.org/aradi/fycollections>`_.

FyCollections is released under the *BSD 2-clause license*.
